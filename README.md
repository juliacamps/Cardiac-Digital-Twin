This repository contains the code developed for the study:

_Harnessing 12-lead ECG and MRI data to personalise repolarisation profiles in cardiac digital twin models for enhanced virtual drug testing_

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2024.103361

## Example data (meshes, ECGs, electrodes, cellular models, digital twins, etc.) to run this code, generate new digital twins, and reproduce the results in the paper can be found in the Cardiac-Digital-Twin-Data repository in Zenodo.
